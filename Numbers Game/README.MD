   The purpose of this program is to add an array of 4 numbers randomly chosen by the user. Once the sum is configured the user chooses a number between 1 and 4 which acts as the index's of the array. The number within the chosen index position is then multiplied by the sum of the 4 numbers chosen by the user. The product is then divided by a random number chosen by the user once more. The Quotient is the user's final answer.'
   Example:
Give me a number
65
Give me a number
75
Give me a number
3
Give me a number
7
150
65 75 3 7 Pick a random number between 1 and 4
3
Random number is 3
This is the product 450
Give me a number to divide the product by
8
This is the Quotient:56
